# Admin Permissions Implementation

## Tasks
- [x] Update POST /api/user: Ensure createdBy is set correctly for ADMIN users
- [x] Update GET /api/user: Filter users based on currentUser permissions (SUPERADMIN sees all, ADMIN sees their created users, USER sees none)
- [x] Update PUT /api/user: Allow ADMIN to update only their created users (not other ADMINS)
- [x] Update DELETE /api/user/[id]: Allow ADMIN to delete only their created users
- [x] Update GET /api/patients: Filter patients by users under the current ADMIN
- [x] Update frontend components: Modify user-management and patient-list to pass currentUserId and show only relevant data
- [x] Test permissions with different user types

## Progress
- Completed backend API updates for user and patient permissions
- Updated frontend components to pass currentUserId
- Need to test the implementation with different user types
